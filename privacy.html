                  Upon connecting your Google Drive account within the application, it utilizes OAuth access_token and the official Google Drive SDK to facilitate any interactions with the Google Drive server. The access_token is securely stored on your device's Keychain, a protected system storage. You have the option to download your personal files from the connected Google Drive account to your device. At any time, you can delete these files from your device. If you wish to revoke access to your Google Drive account, you can do so by accessing the account settings page on the Google Drive server through your web browser. Additionally, within the application, you can disconnect the connected Google Drive account, which will also remove the access_token from your device. When you uninstall the application from your device, all downloaded data and access_token will be deleted as well. It is important to note that the application does not share any information from your Google account.
